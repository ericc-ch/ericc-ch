# Praise the Sun! ☀️

A Soulsborne fans even though I've never played Demon Souls and Bloodborne.

I love Web and Hybrid App development, but I also like doing other things too. Here are a few:

1. Data Science, It's fun playing with data. (At the cost of 90% if my brainpower)
1. Game Development using Unity, because I love games
1. Cyber Security, I tried DDoS-ing my high school server using LOIC (I know it's stupid)

I just graduated from SMK Wikrama Bogor this year.  
But who knows what will happens next.

May the dark sigils guide thee. 🗡️
