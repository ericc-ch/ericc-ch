Hi, I'm Erick

I love open source and the web platform!

~Currently learning Go just so I can use [Charm stack](https://charm.sh)~

Currently bashing my head against the wall trying to wrap my head around [Effect](https://effect.website)

Here's hoping I can be a full time open source maintainer :)

Looking at you, yes you, Evan You

and Anthony Fu

and Douglas Wreden (Sort of an open source maintainer)
